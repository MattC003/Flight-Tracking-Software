# Flight-Tracking-Software
This project is from my Junior year at UConn when I was learning C++ and was tasked with creating a full-stack application to compute all possible flight paths between airports, including layovers. Developed the backend algorithms and integrated a front-end UI to visualize route options and flight tracking functionality.
